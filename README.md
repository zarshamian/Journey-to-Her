Summary:

The year is 2075. After losing a war against evil monsters, the human population has dwindled away. Surviving humans live in fear and hiding, and go to terrifying lengths just to survive. Away from all the wreckage, in an abandoned cottage deep in the woods, she waits for you.

Journey to Her is a text-based adventure game in which you must travel many miles to get back to her.

On your journey, you will encounter monsters of all kinds, shop at underground black markets to buy microchips that will help you along your way, interact with other humans (some helpful, others evil), find treasures on your path and experience flashbacks of her that will provide insight into your motivations and backstory. Who is she? Why is it so important to get back to her? How far are you willing to go to reunite with someone you love?
